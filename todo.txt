* Error Handling:
  * Do not attempt to process overlay, if plugin assembly does not exists
  * If plugin draw errors, capture and show user the error message

* Shadowcopy the plugin, so it can be updated, whilst in use
* Auto reload assembly and redraw, on updating of assembly
* Clean up Form's appearance
* Extract support code from overlay plugin into support assembly (packaged within same nuget as this project)
* Update release references to use nuget references
* Create nuget package for this exe and support assembly.
* Clean up support code to be more DSL
